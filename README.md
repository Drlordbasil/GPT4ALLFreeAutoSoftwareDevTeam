## Description
This program orchestrates an autonomous team of specialized AI agents, each with unique roles. 
These roles range from task assignment (CEO) to code generation (Code Generator). 
Communication between these agents is facilitated through a message queue, ensuring seamless coordination.

## Dependencies
- **gpt4all**: For generating text and tasks.
- **termcolor**: For colored terminal output.
- **multiprocessing**: For parallel execution of roles.

## Features
- **CEO**: Assigns a task to the Software Engineer.
- **Software Engineer**: Decomposes the assigned task into manageable sub-tasks.
- **Code Generator**: Produces code snippets based on the sub-tasks defined.
- **Data Analyst**: Delivers analytical insights based on processed data.
- **QA Engineer**: Executes tests and provides the results.

## Installation
```bash
pip install gpt4all termcolor
```

## Usage
Run the main Python script to initialize the autonomous AI team. 
The agents will perform their tasks in a sequential manner, and the results will be output to the terminal.

```bash
python main.py
```

### Example Output
```
=== CEO: Design a new feature for the software ===
=== Software Engineer: Create a frontend and a backend component for the new feature ===
=== Code Generator: import React from 'react'; ... ===
=== Data Analyst: The data suggests a high level of user engagement ===
=== QA Engineer: All tests passed. The feature is ready for deployment ===
